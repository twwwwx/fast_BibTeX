# fast BibTeX — Chrome Web Store Listing

## Short description
Grab BibTeX from the first Google Scholar result and copy it to your clipboard in one click.

## Detailed description
fast BibTeX is a tiny, focused Chrome extension for researchers, students, and writers who live in Google Scholar.  
Type a paper title, hit Fetch, and your BibTeX is instantly on the clipboard — no extra tabs, no copy‑paste dance.

### Why you will love it
- One‑click BibTeX for the first Scholar result
- Minimal, distraction‑free popup
- Clipboard‑ready output for LaTeX, Overleaf, Zotero, and more

### How it works
1. Click the fast BibTeX icon
2. Enter a reference title
3. Click Fetch
4. Paste anywhere — it is already in your clipboard

### Notes
- Only the first Google Scholar search result is fetched.
- Open Google Scholar in a normal tab first (helps avoid captchas).
- Captchas or rate limits can appear if you query too quickly.
